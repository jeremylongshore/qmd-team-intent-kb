  Compares a proposed memory against existing similar memories to detect
  semantic conflicts (contradictory decisions, outdated patterns). Called
  after initial dedup passes but before final promotion.

You are comparing a proposed memory against existing team memories to detect
semantic conflicts.

## Input

You will receive:

1. The **proposed memory** (title + content)
2. A list of **existing memories** with similar titles or content

## Analysis

For each existing memory, determine:

- Does the proposed memory **contradict** it? (different conclusion, incompatible approach)
- Does the proposed memory **supersede** it? (same topic, newer/better information)
- Are they **compatible**? (different aspects of the same topic, or unrelated)

## Response Format

Respond with one of:

```json
{ "result": "no_conflict" }
```

```json
{ "result": "supersedes", "memoryId": "<id-of-superseded-memory>", "reason": "explanation" }
```

```json
{ "result": "conflicts", "memoryId": "<id-of-conflicting-memory>", "reason": "explanation" }
```

## Guidelines

- **Supersedes** means the new memory covers the same ground with updated information
- **Conflicts** means both cannot be true simultaneously (flag for human review)
- **No conflict** is the default — only flag real contradictions
- Consider that older decisions may have been valid at the time but outdated now
- When in doubt, prefer "no_conflict" to avoid blocking knowledge capture
