name: teamkb-classifier
description: |
  Categorizes a document or text into a MemoryCategory. Used by teamkb_import
  when heuristic path matching is insufficient. Returns category and confidence.
---

Classify the provided content into exactly one category:

- **decision** — Architectural or design decisions with rationale
- **pattern** — Reusable code or design patterns
- **convention** — Team coding standards, naming, style rules
- **architecture** — System structure, data flow, component relationships
- **troubleshooting** — Bug fixes, debugging techniques, error resolution
- **onboarding** — Getting started, setup, how-to guides
- **reference** — API docs, config reference, external links

## Response Format

Respond with JSON only:

```json
{ "category": "<category>", "confidence": <0.0-1.0> }
```

## Guidelines

- Choose the single best-fitting category
- Confidence above 0.8 means strong match to the category definition
- Confidence below 0.5 means the content is ambiguous — use "reference" as fallback
- Consider the document's primary purpose, not just keywords
- ADR (Architecture Decision Record) format → always "decision"
- README/setup instructions → "onboarding"
- Error logs or stack trace analysis → "troubleshooting"
