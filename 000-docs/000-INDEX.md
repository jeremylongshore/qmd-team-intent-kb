### OD — Operations & Deployment (continued)

- `042-OD-OPSM-bbb-qmd-operator-runbook.md` — Bob's Big Brain + Tobi qmd: personal vs team index, `bbb-qmd` wrapper, pin/Dependabot, canary

- `044-AT-DECR-wave0-retrieval-reconciliation.md` — Wave-0 retrieval reconciliation: ship the reranker first (Apache/MIT), defer the dense arm to a measured P2 gate, EmbeddingGemma out. Supersedes only the retrieval-arm + embedder elements of `038-AT-DECR`; unblocks the retrieval beads in the umbrella blueprint (`019-PP-PLAN` A1/B1/B2).
- `045-OD-RNBK-anchor-remote-divergence-recovery.md` — Anchor remote divergence recovery: the private anchor-witness remote (`bobs-big-brain-anchors`, force-push-blocked), the fetch/status divergence check, per-state recovery (ahead = plain push; behind/diverged = investigate with the HISTORY_REWRITTEN tooling before ANY reconciliation), honest trust framing (detectable, not impossible)
- `046-AT-ARCH-what-each-chain-proves-compile-vs-govern-boundary.md` — Substrate-boundary doctrine: the ICO trace chain proves COMPILE, the INTKB audit chain proves GOVERN admission; neither proves the other's claims (nor content truth); the spool manifest SHA-256 + UUID-v5 id lineage are the bridge; walked end-to-end by `curator-cli provenance-walk`
- `047-OD-RNBK-merge-govern-and-anchor-receipts-runbook.md` — merge-govern operator runbook (Wave-2 E3/F3/F4): when/how to run the govern-at-merge CLI, what it does NOT do, signed merge-anchor key custody + rotation (SOPS-encrypted private / committed public), and the opt-in OpenTimestamps receipt for anchor heads with its honest network/trust limits
- `049-AT-DECR-write-time-provenance-origin-tokens.md` — Write-time provenance (GSB Wave-2 H1–H5): HMAC-SHA256 origin tokens over (id, tenantId, capturedAt) keyed by the 0600 `~/.teamkb/origin-secret`, verified structurally before promotion (`origin_token_invalid` receipted reject), accept-with-`unattested` backward compatibility, team-API channel allowlist (`unrecognized_channel` 422), local-mode channel attestation out of scope v1, honest insider-poisoning residual
- `052-AT-DECR-reference-import-flood-2026-08-02.md` — Reference-import flood investigation: 2026-07-16 producer replay, bounded/receipted broad-import admission, and reversible legacy-corpus review

- `016-OD-OPSM-branch-protection-checklist.md` — GitHub branch protection configuration checklist
- `027-OD-OPSM-edge-daemon-runbook.md` — edge-daemon operations runbook (install, config, health check, recovery, upgrade, rollback)
- `040-OD-OPSM-brain-api-tailnet-deploy.md` — brain API tailnet deploy runbook (systemd --user service, token management, team-mode client, verify, hardening gaps)
