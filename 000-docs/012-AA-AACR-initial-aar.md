# Initial AAR — Phase 0 Setup

> After Action Review for the Phase 0 repository setup of qmd-team-intent-kb.

---

## Context

The goal was to establish qmd-team-intent-kb as a production-ready monorepo foundation for a governed team memory platform powered by qmd and Claude Code. Phase 0 covers everything from empty directory to a fully scaffolded, documented, CI-enabled project — without any runtime implementation.

Starting state: Empty repository with no structure, no tooling, no documentation.

Target state: A monorepo with workspace configuration, CI pipeline, comprehensive documentation, and Beads task tracking covering the full implementation roadmap.

---

## What Was Done

### Repository Infrastructure

- Initialized pnpm monorepo with workspace configuration
- Configured TypeScript with strict settings and project references
- Set up ESLint with a shared configuration
- Configured Prettier for consistent formatting
- Integrated Vitest as the test framework
- Created root-level `pnpm validate` script that runs lint, format check, typecheck, and test in sequence

### Documentation (000-docs/)

Created 12 durable documents covering all aspects of the project:

1. Repo blueprint — project identity, purpose, and technical foundations
2. Architecture overview — system design and component relationships
3. Security and threat model — project-specific security analysis
4. Phase plan — 10-phase implementation roadmap
5. Technology decisions — rationale for key technology choices
6. CI/CD pipeline — GitHub Actions configuration and Gemini review integration
7. Data model draft — domain model for the memory platform
8. Release and versioning policy — semver, changelog, and release workflow
9. Contribution workflow — step-by-step guide for contributors
10. Internal Claude operations — Claude Code workflows and skills
11. Risk register — 10 active risks with mitigations
12. This AAR

### CI/CD

- GitHub Actions workflow with lint, format, typecheck, and test jobs
- Gemini code review integration via Workload Identity Federation (WIF)
- Branch protection rules for main

### Project Governance

- Comprehensive CLAUDE.md with project context and conventions
- CONTRIBUTING.md with actionable guidelines
- SECURITY.md with project-specific threat model and reporting process
- CHANGELOG.md initialized with Keep a Changelog format
- LICENSE file (Intent Solutions Proprietary)

### Workspace Scaffolding

Scaffolded 5 apps and 6 packages with placeholder structure:

**Apps**: `cli`, `mcp-server`, `web-dashboard`, `capture-daemon`, `admin-api`

**Packages**: `schema`, `curator`, `qmd-adapter`, `claude-runtime`, `governance`, `shared-utils`

Each contains a placeholder `index.ts` and `package.json` — no runtime code.

### Task Tracking

- Initialized Beads with 10 epics covering the full implementation story
- Created tasks with dependencies across epics
- Established the Beads workflow as a core project convention

---

## What Went Well

### Architecture-First Approach

Documenting the architecture thesis, data model, and security threat model before writing any code was the right call. These documents:

- Force clear thinking about boundaries, responsibilities, and interfaces
- Provide a reference point for Phase 1 implementation decisions
- Make the project approachable for future contributors (or future Claude Code sessions)

### Security Threat Model Is Project-Specific

The security document addresses threats unique to a team memory platform (secret leakage, cross-tenant contamination, MCP trust boundaries) rather than generic web application security. This specificity makes it actionable.

### Phase Plan Provides Clear Roadmap

The 10-phase plan with explicit dependencies and deliverables provides a clear path from scaffolding to production. Each phase is scoped tightly enough to be completable in a reasonable timeframe.

### Contribution Guidelines Are Actionable from Day One

The contribution workflow, commit conventions, and PR process are all documented before any contributions occur. This avoids the common pattern of retrofitting process onto an existing codebase.

### Documentation as Durability

By investing heavily in documentation during Phase 0, the project is resilient to context loss. A new Claude Code session can read the 000-docs/ directory and understand the project's purpose, architecture, conventions, and current state.

---

## What Is Explicitly Scaffolding (Not Implemented)

It is important to be clear about what Phase 0 did NOT produce:

- **No runtime features**: All app and package code is placeholder `index.ts` files with no functional code
- **No API**: No HTTP endpoints, no MCP protocol handling, no CLI commands
- **No qmd integration**: The qmd-adapter package exists but contains no qmd interaction code
- **No actual tests**: Vitest is configured but there are no meaningful test cases (CI validates tooling, not behavior)
- **No database or storage layer**: No data persistence of any kind
- **No authentication or authorization**: No user management, no tenant isolation
- **No search**: No query handling, no result formatting

This is by design. Phase 0 is infrastructure and documentation. Phase 1 begins the real implementation work.

---

## What Could Improve

### Documentation Volume vs. Verification

Twelve documents is a lot to produce in one phase. While each document was written with care, the volume means some may contain inconsistencies between them. Specifically:

- Cross-references between documents may drift as each document is updated independently
- The data model draft and architecture overview describe the same concepts from different angles — if one changes, the other must change too

**Action**: During Phase 1, do a cross-reference audit to ensure all documents are consistent.

### Scaffolding Depth

The placeholder `index.ts` files are minimal. They establish that the package exists but provide no guidance on the intended API surface. A future contributor opening `packages/curator/src/index.ts` would need to read multiple docs to understand what this package should do.

**Action**: In Phase 1, add module-level JSDoc comments to each placeholder that describe the package's responsibility and planned public API.

### Single-Session Risk

All of Phase 0 was produced in a concentrated effort. While this ensures consistency, it also means there was no iterative feedback loop. The architecture and data model are reasonable but untested by implementation.

**Action**: Expect Phase 1 to surface issues with the Phase 0 designs. Be willing to update 000-docs/ documents when implementation reveals better approaches.

---

## Risks Identified

See [011-risk-register.md](./011-risk-register.md) for the full risk register. Key risks surfaced during Phase 0:

1. **Schema design decisions in Phase 1 will constrain everything downstream.** The data model draft is a starting point, but the Zod implementation will force concrete decisions about optionality, defaults, and validation that will be hard to change later. This is the biggest near-term risk.

2. **qmd dependency is not yet validated.** The architecture assumes qmd provides certain capabilities (vector search, semantic matching). Phase 3 will validate these assumptions, but if qmd cannot deliver, the architecture needs significant revision.

3. **Single maintainer.** The documentation-first approach partially mitigates this, but it remains a high-likelihood, high-impact risk.

---

## Next Steps

### Phase 1: Core Schema and Domain Model

The immediate next phase focuses on:

1. Define Zod schemas for all entities in [007-data-model-draft.md](./007-data-model-draft.md)
2. Generate TypeScript types from Zod schemas
3. Write comprehensive validation tests
4. Establish schema versioning strategy
5. Begin qmd adapter research in parallel (what does qmd's API actually look like?)

### Phase 1 Entry Criteria

- Phase 0 complete (this AAR documents completion)
- All Phase 0 docs reviewed and consistent
- Beads epic for Phase 1 has tasks defined and ready

### Phase 1 Exit Criteria

- All entity schemas implemented in `packages/schema`
- Validation tests pass for valid and invalid data
- Schema versioning strategy documented
- qmd adapter research findings documented
