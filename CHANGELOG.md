## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Authenticated `GET /api/audit/receipt-tip` exposes the content-safe global governance-receipt chain head and can resolve a previously observed SHA-256 tip after the chain advances. It verifies the chain before answering, fails closed on tamper signatures, reports legacy unverified rows and benign ordering forks separately, and does not claim to identify the exact search results an agent read. This completes the registrar half of AGP's `gsb_receipt_tip_hash` pointer contract. The chain-boundary documentation now also names the canonical shared spool at `~/.teamkb/spool` rather than the retired `brain/spool` location.

- **Receipted governance-policy upgrade (`curator-cli upgrade-policy`, epic
  `qmd-team-intent-kb-5bm.2`).** New `curator-cli upgrade-policy --tenant <id> [--db] [--dry-run]
  [--json]` brings a store's live governance policy up to the recommended anti-dormancy shape
  (`RECOMMENDED_POLICY_RULES` — every registered rule enabled) and writes a `policy_upgraded` audit
  receipt carrying the previous rules verbatim, so the change is reversible from the chain alone.
  Three explicit outcomes (`upgraded` / `created` / `already-complete`); `--dry-run` previews without
  writing. This is the operator-safe migration path — it never edits the live brain directly. (The
  recommended-policy + dormancy doctor tooling itself shipped earlier under `5bm.10`; this is the
  previously-missing command that applies it to a store.)
- **Bulk-digestion scoping (`5bm.8`).** A new non-default `kb-bulk` collection (`bulk/` export
  subdir): memories whose source is `bulk_import` (whole-machine digestions) now route there via
  `getActiveDirectory` instead of flooding the default-searched category collections (the 2026-07-16
  flood put ~9.7k bulk `reference` files in `kb-guides`). A new `bulk` search scope is the deliberate
  way into that corpus; the default `curated` scope excludes it on both the qmd (collection-level)
  and SQLite-fallback (source-level) paths.

### Changed

- **`bulk_import` candidates are stamped low-trust at the schema boundary (`5bm.8`).** A
  `bulk_import` candidate must now carry `trustLevel` `low` or `untrusted` (the default `medium` is
  refused by `MemoryCandidate`), so a whole-machine digestion can never claim curated-grade trust and
  the `source_trust` rule can gate it. **Migration note:** any pre-PR `bulk_import` candidate stamped
  `medium` under the old emitter convention now **fails closed** at re-validation — this is intended
  (it surfaces mis-stamped digestions rather than admitting them silently), and such a row is
  corrected via the governed recategorization/curation tooling (or a one-shot re-stamp), not dropped.
  Depends on the deferred coordination to have ICO's emitter stamp `bulk_import` low at capture time
  (flagged in PR #310); until then, bulk digestions must carry an explicit low/untrusted stamp.
- **Contradiction-check tokenizer is Unicode-aware (E1 review follow-up).** The token-overlap
  heuristic now tokenizes whole words for space-delimited scripts and per-character for space-less
  CJK (`\p{sc=Han|Hiragana|Katakana|Hangul}` unigrams), replacing the ASCII-only `[a-z0-9]` that
  collapsed all non-Latin text to empty token sets.
- **Contradiction-check lookup is category-scoped at the store (E1 review follow-up).**
  `MemoryRepository.findByTenantAndLifecycleAndCategory` lets the rule filter same-category actives in
  SQL instead of loading and deserializing the whole active set per candidate.

- **Repository renamed** from `jeremylongshore/qmd-team-intent-kb` to
  `jeremylongshore/bobs-big-brain-registrar` on 2026-07-19 (public product name: **Bob's Big Brain
  Registrar**, the govern engine of Bob's Big Brain). GitHub serves 301 redirects from the old URL.
  Deliberately UNCHANGED: the `@qmd-team-intent-kb/*` npm scope, the
  `ghcr.io/jeremylongshore/qmd-team-intent-kb-edge-daemon` container image name, and all
  `qmd-team-intent-kb-*` bead IDs — those are published artifact identifiers, not the repo name.
- `ci/emit-evidence/emit-evidence.ts` now derives the signed evidence manifest's signing subject
  from `GITHUB_REPOSITORY` at runtime (with the new slug as a non-CI fallback) instead of a
  hardcoded repo slug, so the manifest subject always matches the cosign OIDC certificate identity
  — rename-proof, and exactly what the fail-closed dashboard ingest verifies.

## [0.8.0] - 2026-07-18

### Added

- **Fused lexical retrieval on the production query path.** The dormant native FTS5 (BM25) backend
  is now activated and fused with the external qmd binary via deterministic **reciprocal-rank
  fusion** (k=60) behind `QmdAdapter.query()` — a new persistent per-tenant `NativeIndexManager`
  (incremental mtime-diff refresh, first-build fast path 453s → 3.8s on the live 17k-file corpus)
  plus a pure `rrf-fusion`, with `disableNativeFusion` as the kill switch. Kills the 2026-07-16
  0-hits-for-our-own-memory miss class (qmd's keyword-AND tokenizer can't match `governed-brain` /
  `CLAUDE.md`; FTS5's unicode61 tokenizer can), serving stays 100% model-free (#257).
- **Freshness + category rerank on the cited (qmd) path.** `rerankCitedHits` +
  `extractMemoryIdFromCitation` in `@qmd-team-intent-kb/common`, applied in `searchViaQmd` after
  score normalisation, so last week's decision no longer loses to a year-old reference doc; every
  hit keeps its `qmd://` citation (#256).
- **Retrieval eval as a CI-gated regression series.** A self-contained stratified ratchet over a
  committed synthetic corpus (never `~/.teamkb`) that fails if lexical **or** semantic Recall@10
  regresses, reported separately (#243); a dedicated `tokenization` stratum locking the two literal
  2026-07-16 incident queries (fused 5/5 vs 2/5 with fusion off) that emits a machine-readable
  `eval-results/synthetic-v1.json` artifact on pass and fail (#258); and the govern-decision +
  provenance evals promoted to a named required CI job (#242).
- **Recommended full-coverage governance policy + anti-dormancy gate** (`packages/policy-engine`):
  `RECOMMENDED_POLICY_RULES` / `buildRecommendedPolicy` covering every registered rule, plus
  `findUncoveredRuleTypes` / `assertPolicyCompleteness` — a CI gate that makes it impossible to add
  a rule the recommended policy leaves inert (the live policy ran only 2 of 8 rules, a direct cause
  of the 2026-07-16 ~15k-candidate flood) (#266). Live-policy dormancy is now surfaced as a distinct
  field in `GET /api/health` so an operator can see inert rules (#278).
- **Governed in-place recategorization** — a tool + API + receipted audit transition to correct a
  memory's category without supersede-and-recreate, which was inflating lifecycle churn (#272).
- **`bulk_import` MemorySource** added to the enum + `curated_memories.source` CHECK so policy can
  gate whole-machine digestions distinctly from deliberate imports (#274).
- **Brain team-bridge API hardening** (EPIC 0 / R-series): one-shot promote-candidate →
  governed-memory endpoint (#203); no-comp/no-PII disclosure gate enforced at candidate intake
  (#201, regexes hardened #202); agent-review approve/reject surface + candidate status-flip fix
  (#238); server-side candidate-intake override with a provenance receipt (#230); idempotent
  tenant-scoped content-hash candidate dedup (#241); per-actor capture quota + aligned DB path
  (#240); pre-hashed scrypt tokens accepted at rest (#227); durable revoke-by-actor persisted
  revocation list (#229); promote() writes wrapped in one transaction for atomic receipts (#231);
  immutable tag-pinned release deploy for the brain API (#228) with a tailnet deploy runbook (#211).
- **EPIC 1 merge substrate (demand-gated, foundation only):** content-derived UUID v5 +
  deterministic audit-chain timestamps (#206), a govern-at-merge gate that re-derives the union as
  untrusted (#207), a per-actor Ed25519 signed DAG anchor + merge-aware verifier (#208), a
  cross-repo namespace drift guard (#210), and residual EPIC 0/1 hardening — enum-membership scan,
  same-content dedup, gate-entry id invariant, N-way merge proof (#209).
- **First real retrieval + govern numbers:** hand-labeled Recall@10 / nDCG@10 over the live corpus
  (#223) and per-check govern-decision precision/recall with an R10 boundary-scan fix (#221).
- **Advisory CI reviewer + evidence:** an in-repo **MiniMax-M3 two-lane** PR reviewer (a defect
  lane and an adversarial-claims lane) with `REVIEW.md` as the canonical reviewer law (#263); signed
  gate-result evidence emitted for the labs dashboard (#252); a `changelog-updated` dispatch to the
  umbrella on merge (#250); a repo-tailored `.greptile` config (#232); and `SUPPORT.md` (#244).
- **`scripts/bbb-qmd`** — operator wrapper that runs the pinned `@tobilu/qmd` against the team brain
  index (`~/.teamkb/qmd-index/<tenant>` via XDG), not personal `~/.cache/qmd`. `pnpm bbb-qmd --which`
  shows binary + version + tenant paths. Ride Tobi's releases via Dependabot pin; do not fork qmd.
- **Operator runbook** `000-docs/042-OD-OPSM-bbb-qmd-operator-runbook.md` and **onboarding Q-bank**
  `000-docs/043-OD-EVAL-onboarding-qbank-v1.md` for day-1 retrieval regression scoring.
- **Search canary** expanded with SOPS / beads / Contabo VPS known-positive controls (fail loud if
  estate themes disappear from the index).
- **`pnpm eval:onboarding`** (`scripts/eval-onboarding-qbank.sh`) — day-1 outsider keyword probes via
  `bbb-qmd`; exit 0 at ≥80% (baseline after day-1 pack: **23/24**).
- **B1 auto-govern primitives** (`packages/store` + `packages/curator`) — a **marker-based** inbox:
  `CandidateStatus` widened so insert-only `candidates` are retired by a terminal status change,
  **never deleted** (the review queue + only copy is preserved), plus tenant-scoped content-hash
  dedup and spool archiving. The deterministic foundation for governing the remote-capture inbox.
  (jfv.2.1, #236)

### Changed

- **Ontology write-path hardening (epic `5bm`), so the governed store can't be enum-smuggled.**
  `assertMemoryEnumMembership` now guards `category` / `trust_level` / `sensitivity` / `lifecycle` /
  `source` / `author.type` at the top of `MemoryRepository.insert` and `update` (previously only
  read-time schema validation stood between a raw caller and a disclosure-shaped string in an enum
  column), plus row-level CHECK constraints on the new-DB DDL (#265); migration **v9** backfills
  those CHECK constraints onto the live legacy `curated_memories` table via a fail-closed, in-place
  rebuild with zero blast radius on fresh DBs (#277). The promoter now persists the **classified**
  sensitivity from the deterministic content classifier instead of hardcoding `internal` — which had
  made the exporter's confidential/restricted skip dead code (#267). `updateLifecycle` now rejects
  transitions the lifecycle state graph forbids (#268). The spool `MemoryCandidate` carries a
  validated `schemaVersion` so a future ICO v2 line is rejected, not silently downgraded to v1 (#271).
- **Dependabot: hold `typescript` at its current major.** Added `typescript` semver-major to the
  ignore list (alongside `dependency-cruiser` and `@eslint/js`): the dev-dependencies group tried to
  bump `typescript` 5.x → **7.0.2** — the native/preview compiler — which crashes `@typescript-eslint`
  and broke the `validate` Lint gate. Held back until the lint/tsx toolchain supports TS 7.
- **Merged the batched dependency-group updates** (#234 dev-deps, #235 prod-deps): 13 dev-dep bumps
  landed (vitest, knip, prettier 3.9.5, testcontainers, tsx, `@intentsolutions/audit-harness`, …)
  with `typescript` held at 5.x; reformatted one test file for prettier 3.9.5.
- Ignore `.worktrees/` (local Agent-isolation worktree checkouts).

### Fixed

- **Candidate intake: id-first idempotency + created vs already_exists knowledge.**
  `CandidateService.intake` now short-circuits on existing **id** (same tenant) before content-hash
  dedup, so session-stable client ids collapse re-distilled retries. Returns
  `{ candidate, intake: 'created' | 'already_exists' }`; `POST /api/candidates` responds **201** +
  `intake: created` or **200** + `intake: already_exists`. Skips a second `proposed` receipt on
  collapse. Closes the Property 1/2 seam called out in the fire-and-forget writer review (#249).
- **git-exporter fails closed on an unmapped category** instead of laundering it into the
  governance-approved `curated/` bucket (#269), with the category→directory mapper locked to the
  schema enum (#270); a single malformed memory is now **quarantined and reported** rather than
  aborting the whole export run (#276).
- **Retrieval reliability:** idempotent qmd reindex + a search-health canary to end silent 0-hit
  degradation (#220).
- **Honest audit-chain verify:** sequence-ordering + `CHAIN_FORK` classification (#212); a byte-pinned
  exception manifest + 3-state audit-break classifier (#214); provenance-integrity now passes on
  no-tampering and discloses benign forks (#215).
- **Govern precision:** gate the heroku UUID rule + converge the PII vocab to raise precision (#224).
- **repo-resolver:** classify git "dubious ownership" as `NotAGitRepo` (#213).

### Security

- **Read-time sensitivity enforcement — confidential/restricted memories are never returned on any
  search path.** The git-exporter already skipped them from the qmd index at write time, but the API
  SQLite fallback and the MCP local-mode path still returned raw `curated_memories` rows; a
  default-exclude read filter closes that leak (#275).
- **Closed two secret-scan evasions the govern-eval measured** — split-newline and base64-wrapped
  keys — so a smuggled credential no longer slips the disclosure gate (#222).

## [0.7.0] - 2026-06-19

### Added

- **Retrieval backend foundations (epic `0t9`).** A native FTS5 (BM25) keyword backend that drops the external qmd binary for keyword search (#192); a backend-agnostic Recall@10 / nDCG@10 eval harness that gates BM25 against a future semantic path (#191); and SHA-256-pinned, fail-closed retrieval-model weight verification (#190). Decision of record: ship BM25 now, eval-gate a lean native sqlite-vec (EmbeddingGemma-300M) semantic path; skip qmd's heavy hybrid. See ADR `000-docs/038-AT-DECR`.
- **External anchor log for the audit chain** — detects silent full-chain rewrites that a local re-hash would otherwise hide (#187).
- **Audit-events hash chain + `verify-audit-chain` CLI** (#154), with spool-manifest SHA-256 verification on ingest and quarantine of tampered files (#156).
- **`curator-cli`** — the ingest → policy → promote governance pipeline as a CLI (#153); optional `evalCallback` wired into `promote()` emitting eval-result events (#168).
- **QMD functional eval surface** — three evaluators (#167) plus an eval-result audit action (#166).
- **`exporter-cli` + real-qmd integration** for demo stages 5-6 (#158).
- **Weekly cited-query count per-teammate report** (#186).
- **Plugin + MCP surface** — a self-contained marketplace MCP client (install-once, no build); the `intent-brain` plugin with `/brain` + `/brain-promote` skills; a `teamkb_search` MCP tool with a `TEAMKB_API_URL` hosting flip; qmd wired into search for `qmd://` citations.
- **Per-user auth** — per-user tokens, an admin-only write gate, and a per-read access audit.
- **Quickstart** — qmd indexing + curated-answer query; full compile when `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` is set.

### Changed

- **Relicensed to Apache-2.0** and added the `@intentsolutions/core` dependency (#166).
- **qmd tracked as a pinned devDependency** for controlled auto-bump (#161); bumped to qmd 2.5.3.
- Refactored `edge-daemon` `runCycle` into phases and tightened the CRAP complexity gate 40 → 30 (#157).
- Grouped the Dependabot config (dev / production / github-actions) and merged a batch of dependency updates.

### Fixed

- Soft-fail the Codecov upload on Dependabot PRs — secrets are withheld from Dependabot runs, so the token-less upload was failing every dependency-update PR (#193).
- Install qmd in CI so the qmd-gated integration tests actually run (#160).
- Bridge the git-exporter layout to qmd collections (#159).
- Correct the compile-then-govern URL to the `intent-solutions-io` org.

### Security

- **Tenant-scope the audit read API** — closes a cross-tenant audit-log leak (#169).

## [0.6.0] - 2026-05-15

### Security

- **Cleared 6 high-severity dev-tooling CVEs.** `pnpm.overrides` block pins `picomatch@2: ^2.3.2` (closes ReDoS via micromatch/fast-glob/knip path), `picomatch@4: ^4.0.4` (closes ReDoS in newer path via vite/fdir), `fast-uri: ^3.1.2` (closes path traversal + host confusion via ajv/Stryker). Direct `vite: ^7.3.2` devDep added to pull patched vite for vitest peer (closes `server.fs.deny` bypass + arbitrary file read via dev server). `pnpm audit --audit-level=high` is now clean.

### Added

- **Intent Solutions Testing SOP — Batch 1** (PR #126): `tests/TESTING.md` policy file, `tests/RTM.md` requirements traceability matrix seed, husky + lint-staged pre-commit hooks, vitest coverage thresholds (line 80, branch 70, function 75), Stryker mutation testing config, Semgrep SAST job, CLAUDE.md Testing SOP section. Closes GH #90/#91/#92/#93/#94/#97.
- **Intent Solutions Testing SOP — Batch 2**: dependency-cruiser monorepo architecture rules (`.dependency-cruiser.cjs`) enforced in CI via `pnpm depcruise`. Encodes 6 invariants from `000-docs/003-AT-DSGN-system-thesis.md` as machine-verifiable import-graph rules: packages must not depend on apps; no cross-app imports except apps/curator (which publishes a workspace package); no circular deps; test-fixtures may only be imported by tests; no dist/ imports; all imports must resolve. Closes GH #95.
- **Real gitleaks secret scanning** via `gitleaks-action@v2` on every PR — replaces the prior homegrown `git grep` regex scanner that only fired on PRs touching `package.json`/`pnpm-lock.yaml`. Closes GH #96.
- **Intent Solutions Testing SOP — Batch 3**: `tests/PERSONAS.md` declares the 6 distinct user roles the system serves (developer, curator, org-admin, auditor, operator, bot-agent) with 23 key flows and critical-tier marking. `tests/JOURNEYS.md` declares 6 end-to-end user flows (memory-capture, memory-retrieval, vault-import, policy-update, audit-verification, wiki-link-resolution) with 43 step-by-step mappings. `tests/TESTING.md` §Traceability updated to reflect new artifacts. Test-to-persona / step-to-test linking infrastructure deferred to a follow-up pass (annotation convention TBD). Closes GH #99.
- **Intent Solutions Testing SOP — Batch 4**: `scripts/crap-score.ts` — TypeScript-AST-aware cyclomatic complexity scanner (ports CCSC's reference implementation, adapted for the monorepo to walk `packages/*/src` + `apps/*/src`). Wired to CI as a new `Complexity gate (CRAP / Wall 5)` step. Initial threshold 40 with 4 points of headroom over the current ceiling (`apps/edge-daemon` `runCycle` at 36) — tightening to the Wall 5 ideal of 30 tracked in `qmd-team-intent-kb-igs` (refactor `runCycle` first). Added `tsx` as a root devDep to run the script. Closes GH #100.
- **Intent Solutions Testing SOP — Batch 5**: testcontainers infrastructure for L4 integration tests. After a survey of every L4 surface (per `tests/TESTING.md` §"L4 — partial waiver"), no current code path requires a real-service container — but the audit explicitly tracked the gap and Batch 5 establishes the pattern. Adds `testcontainers` + `@testcontainers/postgresql` + `pg` devDeps. Ships one demonstrative test (`tests/integration/postgres-forward-compat.test.ts`): spins up `postgres:16-alpine`, applies the store DDL (with documented SQLite→postgres translation), round-trips a candidate row, verifies PRIMARY KEY uniqueness, sanity-checks the tenant index — surfaces dialect-specific SQL early. Separate `integration` CI job that fires on push to main and on PRs labeled `integration` — does NOT slow the fast `validate` loop. Three documented trigger conditions for expanding L4 coverage are tracked in `qmd-team-intent-kb-2r6` (P3). Closes GH #98.
- **Intent Solutions Testing SOP — Batch 6**: contract testing via OpenAPI snapshot, replacing the generic Pact recommendation that doesn't fit this monorepo's shape (no internal service-to-service HTTP boundary; no external consumer code yet). Ships `apps/api/src/__tests__/openapi-contract.test.ts` — boots `apps/api` in-process, fetches `GET /openapi.json`, snapshot-tests the structural surface (paths × methods, schema names, security schemes, tag names). Any unintentional API surface change fails CI until a contributor explicitly runs `pnpm vitest --update-snapshots` and the diff becomes a code-review signal. Forward trigger to install actual Pact (`@pact-foundation/pact`) tracked in `qmd-team-intent-kb-4zw` (P3) — fires when an external consumer repo is created and deployed independently from `apps/api` with a different release cadence. Closes GH #101.
- **Intent Solutions Testing SOP — Batch 7 (closing pin)**: `scripts/harness-pin.sh` + committed `.harness-hash`. SHA-256 manifest of every engineer-owned policy artifact in the repo (`tests/TESTING.md`, `tests/RTM.md`, `tests/PERSONAS.md`, `tests/JOURNEYS.md`, `.dependency-cruiser.cjs`, `stryker.config.mjs`, `vitest.config.ts`, `scripts/crap-score.ts`). New CI step `Policy-artifact hash pin (harness-pin --verify)` fails on any unrecognized policy-byte change. AI agents can update observational sections freely but cannot silently change policy without engineer-initiated re-pin (`pnpm harness-pin:init`). Repo-local script encodes the right pin set; upstream pattern-configurability tracked in `qmd-team-intent-kb-tpp` (P3). Closes GH #102. **All 14 audit-tests issues from the 2026-04-24 audit are now closed.**

### Changed

- **`.github/workflows/security.yml`** broadened: gitleaks runs on every PR (secrets can land in any file). `audit` + `lockfile-integrity` jobs continue to gate dep-touching PRs only (their narrow scope is intentional).
- **`.github/workflows/ci.yml`**: new `Architecture rules (dependency-cruiser)` step between `Type check` and `Test`.

### Fixed

- **`apps/api/tsconfig.json` + `apps/mcp-server/tsconfig.json`**: added the missing `{ "path": "../curator" }` project reference. Both apps import from `@qmd-team-intent-kb/curator` (an `apps/curator`-exported workspace package) but lacked the project reference, so clean CI builds failed with `TS2307: Cannot find module '@qmd-team-intent-kb/curator'`. Local builds masked the issue via composite-build cache. This had been the root cause of CI redness on main since the 2026-04-16 v0.5.0 wiki-link PR introduced the imports.
- **`package.json` `pnpm.onlyBuiltDependencies`**: added `better-sqlite3`, `esbuild`, `husky` so that pnpm 9's build-script security model allows the native bindings to compile on clean install. Without this, 451 of 1,312 tests fail with "Could not locate the bindings file" on every fresh clone.

## [0.5.0] - 2026-04-16

### Added

- **Knowledge Graph**: `memory_links` table with 5 link types (relates_to, supersedes, contradicts, depends_on, part_of), bidirectional neighbor queries, and recursive CTE graph traversal up to configurable depth.
- **Import Batches**: `import_batches` table for batch lifecycle tracking (active → completed | rolled_back) with file/created/rejected/skipped counts.
- **Vault Import Pipeline**: Recursive Markdown directory walker with `.obsidian/`, `.trash/`, `.git/` exclusion; YAML frontmatter parser (title, category, tags); content hash collision detection against curated memories, candidates, and intra-batch duplicates; batch-tracked candidate creation; rollback capability.
- **Import API Routes**: `POST /api/import/preview` (dry-run), `POST /api/import` (execute), `GET /api/import/batches` (list), `GET /api/import/batches/:id` (detail), `DELETE /api/import/batches/:id` (rollback).
- **Graph Traversal API**: `GET /api/memories/:id/neighbors` (bidirectional links), `GET /api/memories/:id/graph?depth=N` (recursive traversal, max depth 5).
- **Wiki-Link Resolution**: Parser for `[[slug]]` and `[[slug|display]]` syntax with code-block awareness. Write-path: auto-creates `relates_to` graph edges during promotion. Read-path: `?resolve_links=true` query param on memory GET rewrites links to API URLs.
- **MCP Tools**: `teamkb_vault_preview`, `teamkb_vault_import`, `teamkb_vault_rollback` for Obsidian vault import; `teamkb_neighbors` for graph exploration.
- **Schema Enums**: `LinkType`, `LinkSource`, `ImportBatchStatus` for graph and import domain model.
- **Repositories**: `MemoryLinksRepository` (CRUD + neighbors + traverse), `ImportBatchRepository` (CRUD + updateCounts + complete + rollback).
- **Curator Supersession Edges**: Promoter persists `supersedes` graph edges with Jaccard similarity weight when `MemoryLinksRepository` is provided.
- **Git Exporter**: `formatMemoryAsMarkdown` accepts optional `LinkResolver` callback for wiki-link resolution on export.
- Import conversion recipes documentation (`000-docs/030-DR-GUID-import-conversion-recipes.md`) covering Obsidian, Notion, Google Docs, Confluence, and pandoc workflows.

### Changed

- **Zod 4 Migration**: `packages/schema` and `packages/repo-resolver` migrated from zod@3 to zod@4. Fixed `z.record(z.unknown())` → `z.record(z.string(), z.unknown())` and nested `.default({})` explicit full defaults for Zod 4 compatibility.
- **MCP Server**: Removed inline enum workarounds — now imports `MemoryCategory` and `MemoryLifecycleState` directly from schema package.
- `CandidateRepository.insert()` accepts optional `importBatchId` for batch association.
- `CandidateRepository.deleteByBatch()` enables batch rollback.

### Fixed

- `MemoryLinksRepository.traverse()` uses `ROW_NUMBER` window function for deterministic results when multiple paths to the same node exist.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-04-15

### Added

- `apps/api`: generated OpenAPI 3.1 spec served at `GET /openapi.json` and Swagger UI at `GET /docs`, powered by `@fastify/swagger` + `@fastify/swagger-ui`. Routes declare minimal schema metadata (tags, summary, description) for navigable documentation. The spec and docs UI are exempt from API key authentication so they stay publicly reachable.
- npm publishing configuration for reusable library packages (`@qmd-team-intent-kb/schema`, `@qmd-team-intent-kb/common`, `@qmd-team-intent-kb/repo-resolver`) — `publishConfig.access = public`, `files` allowlist, and minimal package READMEs. Internal-only packages (`store`, `qmd-adapter`, `claude-runtime`, `test-fixtures`, `policy-engine`) remain `private: true`. Strategy documented in `000-docs/029-OD-RELS-npm-publishing-strategy.md`.
- `apps/edge-daemon`: configurable health-server bind host via `DAEMON_HEALTH_HOST` environment variable. Defaults to `127.0.0.1` for security; set to `0.0.0.0` for container deployments.
- `apps/edge-daemon`: repo-scope filtering now surfaces `unscoped` candidate count for operator visibility when candidates bypass scoping.

### Changed

- Consolidated shared test fixture factories (`makeCandidate`, `makeMemory`, `RecordingLogger`) into `@qmd-team-intent-kb/test-fixtures` package. All test files now import from the shared package.
- Removed unused code paths identified by knip sweep, including vestigial logger implementations and weak type casts.
- Schema tests refactored to use rest-destructure pattern instead of `as Record<string, unknown>` delete pattern.
- Store repositories now validate on read with Zod instead of type casts.
- Upgraded `actions/checkout` to v6, `pino` to v10.3.1, `prettier` to v3.8.3.

### Fixed

- `apps/edge-daemon`: health-server start now properly awaited during `stop()` to prevent resource leaks.
- `apps/edge-daemon`: systemd unit override now correctly configures spool and PID paths to `/var/lib/edge-daemon`.
- `apps/edge-daemon`: `pino-pretty` moved from `devDependencies` to `dependencies` for production logging.
- `000-docs`: runbook Health Check section now documents `/healthz` and `/last-cycle` endpoints.
- `.github/workflows`: Gemini review prompt and MCP server configuration restored after accidental removal.

### Security

- Release workflow now builds, pushes, and signs the edge-daemon container image on tag pushes. Images are published to `ghcr.io/jeremylongshore/qmd-team-intent-kb-edge-daemon`, signed keyless via `cosign` using GitHub Actions OIDC (Rekor transparency log), and accompanied by SLSA Level 3 build provenance generated by `slsa-github-generator`. Verification procedure documented in `000-docs/028-OD-SECU-release-signing.md`. (Repo renamed 2026-07-19 to `jeremylongshore/bobs-big-brain-registrar`: the cosign `--certificate-identity-regexp` must use the new slug for post-rename releases; the GHCR image name intentionally keeps the historical slug.)

## [0.3.0] - 2026-03-19

### Added

- MCP server (`apps/mcp-server`) with 5 tools: `teamkb_propose`, `teamkb_import`, `teamkb_status`, `teamkb_transition`, `teamkb_sync`
- Claude Code plugin packaging: `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`, `.mcp.json`, `hooks/hooks.json`
- SessionStart hook (`scripts/bootstrap.sh`) for database initialization and qmd collection setup
- Stop hook (`scripts/flush-spool.sh`) for end-of-session spool draining
- TeamKB skill definition (`skills/teamkb/SKILL.md`) for ambient capture guidance
- 4 subagent definitions: `teamkb-curator`, `teamkb-classifier`, `teamkb-conflict-checker`, `teamkb-scout`
- Rejection feedback channel (`apps/edge-daemon/src/feedback.ts`) for governance learning
- FTS5 virtual table for full-text search with ranked results
- Schema migrations framework (`packages/store`) with `schema_migrations` table
- Intra-batch deduplication in curator pipeline
- Path traversal validation in spool writer and git exporter
- Per-agent spool files for multi-agent concurrency

### Fixed

- Node 20 compatibility using fast-glob instead of node:fs/promises glob (requires Node 22)
- Timing-safe API key comparison with `crypto.timingSafeEqual`
- Fail-closed authentication in production mode
- LIKE wildcard escaping (`%`, `_`, `\`) in SQL text search
- Shutdown handler exits with non-zero code on failure

### Security

- File permissions 0700 on `~/.teamkb/` directory
- `busy_timeout = 5000` pragma for WAL mode concurrency
- `--` argument separator for qmd CLI commands

## [0.2.0] - 2026-03-19

### Added

- Search API endpoint (`POST /api/search`) with freshness-aware reranking combining raw scores with exponential time decay and category boost
- Edge daemon (`apps/edge-daemon`) with full implementation: local spool watch, curation cycle, staleness sweep, index sync, PID locking, graceful shutdown
- Staleness automation — auto-deprecate active memories older than configurable `staleDays` threshold with audit trail
- Freshness scoring utilities (`packages/common`) with exponential decay, category boost weights, and generic reranking function
- SQL text search on MemoryRepository with LIKE-based query, tenant/category filters, active-only scope
- Graduated relevance scoring in policy engine: content length tiers, unique word count signal, manual/import source bonus

### Changed

- Relevance score rule now uses graduated weights: title (+0.20), content 50-200 chars (+0.10), content >200 chars (+0.20), unique words >15 (+0.10), manual/import source (+0.10)
- Upgraded Vitest to v4.1, ESLint to v10, Zod to v4, @types/node to v25
- Added `vitest.config.ts` for explicit test file discovery

### Fixed

- TypeScript project references now properly configured across all packages
